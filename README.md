Bookmark important lines of code to quickly get back to later.

## Shortcuts

These shortcuts are preset:

- `Cmd+B` (`Ctrl+B`) — toggle bookmarks (multiple cursors supported)
- `Cmd+Shift+B` (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) — clear all bookmarks in current file
- `F2` — move cursor to the next bookmarked line of code (cursor is moved at the end of the line)

## Features

- bookmarks are set for lines (not for selection ranges)
- **multiple cursors supported!** — add multiple bookmarks with a single shortcut / command run
- context dependent toggling
  - for single cursor mode - normal bookmark toggle is performed
  - for multiple cursors - bookmarks are set if there is at least one line without a bookmark. Otherwise bookmarks are unset

## Thank you!
