# Bookmarks NG

Bookmark important lines of code to quickly get back to later.

## Setup

After installation I recommend to setup shortcuts for commands:

- `Cmd+B` (`Ctrl+B`) to toggle bookmarks
- `Cmd+Shift+B` (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) to clear all bookmarks

## Features

- bookmarks are set for lines and not for selection ranges
- **multiple cursors support!** add bookmarks for all cursor lines with a single shortcut
- context dependent bookmarks: if there are no bookmarks at some cursor positions - bookmarks are set. Otherwise they are unset.

## Thank you!
